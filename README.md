# CruzHacks-2021
Submission for the UCSC 2021 CruzHacks hackathon. 

Code will not work for the intended purpose as the hack is incomplete. For the submission, I learned a new web automation library, Selenium, in addition to a new API, Webdriver. I learned how to use the open source software to automate mundane tasks such as filling out the UCSC health survey form. Although I achieved initial small success, I hit a roadblock attempting to bypass UCSC's anti-automation for the DUO authentication service. Nonetheless, I learned much about web automation through the Selenium library along with the Webdriver API.  I also put into practice my computer networking skils from my class by dissecting web pages and going through HTML code and TCP header fields.
